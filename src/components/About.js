          Art is not for everybody? Art = commerce? Art is life? How far would
          YOU go to become a part of it?
          <br />
          <br />
          Our main hero, Spike, has become the superior criminal among two most
          dangerous gangs of Metacity - Nomads and Gangsters! But,
          unfortunately, there are so few heroes like him...
          <br />
          Therefore we need YOUR help!
          <br />
          <br />
          Look, itâ€™s simple as that - you cooperate with us, and we reward you
          with valuable and unique pieces of art!
          <br />
          <br />
          LET'S MAKE ART A COMMON HERITAGE AGAIN!
          <br />
          <br />
          Are you ready to join The Gang? Then keep your weapons up! The
          Cryminals are coming...
