          Art is not for everybody? Art = commerce? Art is life? How far would
          YOU go to become a part of it?
          <br />
          <br />
          Our main hero, Spike, has become the superior criminal among two most
          dangerous gangs of Metacity - Nomads and Gangsters! But,
          unfortunately, there are so few heroes like him...
          <br />
          Therefore we need YOUR help!
          <br />
          <br />
          Look, itâ€™s simple as that - you cooperate with us, and we reward you
          with valuable and unique pieces of art!
          <br />
          <br />
          LET'S MAKE ART A COMMON HERITAGE AGAIN!
          <br />
          <br />
          Are you ready to join The Gang? Then keep your weapons up! The
          Cryminals are coming...
        </p>

      <h2 className={classes.title}>HOW DO WE SHARE THE LOOT?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Owning just 1 Cryminal entitles you to your share of these NFTs!
        </li>
        <li>
          Every single Cryminal has a chance to obtain the stolen cash and
          goods!
        </li>
        <li>
          Owning more Cryminals increases your odds to split the Cryme Pool!
        </li>
        <li>
          We input all minted token IDs into randomizer and find out our lucky
          partners in crime, who share the plunder!
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 className={classes.title}>THE EXTRAS</h2>
      <p>
        The collection will also include few ultrarare characters! Here is a
        little hint to let you imagine how they will look like :)
